# Recursive navigation Notes

## Background

The navigation hierarchy provided by Just the Docs is currently limited to three levels:

1. Top-level pages with no `parent` field.
2. Pages whose `parent` field is the title of a level-1 page.
3. Pages whose `parent` field is the title of a level-2 page, and whose `grand_parent` field is the title of a top-level page.

The current implementation requires parent pages to have `has_children: true`, and `grand_parent` fields to be consistent with the `parent` fields of their parent pages. Level-2 pages may have the same title when they have different `parent` fields. And level-3 pages may have the same title when they have different `parent` fields or different `grand_parent` fields.

In [PR #192](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs/pull/192), [Eugene Kuzmenko](https://github.com/thealjey) proposed allowing the navigation to have unbounded depth, and provided a very elegant implementation (using recursive inclusion of Liquid files) with the following features:

* makes navigation recursive, which means that it can go down to an arbitrary depth
* makes the notion of grand parents/children obsolete. If a page is a child of a page, that itself is a child of another page, that automatically makes this page a grandchild.
* `has_children` and `grand_parent` options are removed as unnecessary
* breadcrumbs are no longer dependent on main navigation setting certain variables
* `nav_exclude` excludes the page from any depth in the menu hierarchy

The implementation of navigation in PR #192 assumes that all pages used as parents have different titles, so that the `parent` fields alone determine the hierarchy. If two parent pages happen to have the same title, the resulting navigation hierarchy includes their combined children twice. The only work-around is to change the page titles to make them all different.

It is possible to adapt the implementation from PR #192 using optional `grand_parent` fields. Existing 3-level sites would not require any changes. However, it is unclear how to best to generalise `grand_parent` to more then three levels, to support the kind of navigation hierarchy mentioned in the following comment on PR #192:

> [...] standardize pages and subpages for easy reading (e.g. all docs for microservices have the same format and same child page names).

## Current proposal

The current proposal is based on the following assumptions:

* Top-level pages cannot have the same title
* Children of the same parent cannot have the same title
* A child cannot have the same title as its parent or any of its ancestors

It implements the following features:

* If no two pages on your website have the same `title`, you only need to set the `parent` titles to fix the hierarchy. You can also have the same `title` on pages that have no children, provided that they have different `parent` titles.

* If two parents have the same `title`, but different grandparents, you can set their `grand_parent` titles to distinguish between their parents. The `grand_parent` title needs to be the same as the `parent` of the `parent`.

* For resolving parents in deeper navigation structures, you can set the `ancestor` field of a page to the title of any page reachable by following successive references to `parent` titles.  

* If you want the navigation structure in different parts of your website to look the same, you can add the title of the top page of each part as the `ancestor` of all its sub-pages. 

* Instead of using `ancestor`, you can set an arbitrary number or string as the `section_id` for each part, and add it as the `in_section` field on all the descendant pages of that part.

## Implementation overview

[regression tests]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/tree/rec-nav-cache/_tests

See the comments in the files referenced below for further explanation of the implementation. The [regression tests] include examples exploiting all the above features for disambiguating parents in recursive navigation hierarchies.

[default layout]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/blob/rec-nav-cache/_layouts/default.html

The [default layout] calls:

- [`main`] to output the main navigation for the current page,
- [`crumbs`] to output any breadcrumb navigation at the top of the page, and
- [`toc`] to output the list of any child page navigation at the bottom of the page.

[`_includes/nav/`]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/tree/rec-nav-cache/_includes/nav

All the files that implement the navigation are in the [`_includes/nav/`] folder. All variables assigned by the code are prefixed by `nav_` (which is elided when referring to variables in the descriptions below).

[`main`]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/blob/rec-nav-cache/_includes/nav/main.html

[`main`]
- called from the [default layout]
- outputs the main navigation for ordinary pages and for each just-the docs collection

[`collection`]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/blob/rec-nav-cache/_includes/nav/collection.html

[`collection`]
- called from  [`main`]
- creates the `parenthood` grouped array based on the `parent` fields
- if the current page is in the `pages` parameter, calls [`page`] to locate it
- calls [`links`] to output the navigation links

[`page`]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/blob/rec-nav-cache/_includes/nav/page.html

[`page`]
- called from [`collection`]
- when `direct` is true: heuristic search using the directory hierarchy, may fail
- when `direct` is false: exhaustive search, always succeeds
- traverses the nav hierarchy top-down until it reaches the current page, then:
  - sets `page_ancestors` to the array of its ancestors, for use by [`crumbs`]
  - sets `page_path` to the string of indices leading to it, for use by [`links`]
  - sets `page_children` to the sorted array of direct children, for use by [`toc`]
- uses [`children`] to determine the children of each node

[`links`]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/blob/rec-nav-cache/_includes/nav/links.html

[`links`]
- called from [`collection`] and [`node`]
- uses [`sorted`] to sort the nodes
- traverses the nav hierarchy top-down, outputting an HTML link for each non-excluded node using [`node`] or [`inactive_node`]
- uses `page_path` to test whether each node is active
- uses [`children`] to determine the children of each node

[`node`]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/blob/rec-nav-cache/_includes/nav/node.html

[`node`]
- called from [`links`]
- outputs the link for a node, then for its children using [`links`] or [`inactive_links`]

[`inactive_links`]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/blob/rec-nav-cache/_includes/nav/inactive_links.html

[`inactive_links`]
- called from [`node`] and [`inactive_node`]
- uses [`sorted`] to sort the nodes
- traverses the nav hierarchy top-down, outputting an HTML link for each non-excluded node using [`inactive_node`]
- uses [`children`] to determine the children of each node

[`inactive_node`]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/blob/rec-nav-cache/_includes/nav/inactive_node.html

[`inactive_node`]
- called from [`inactive_links`]
- outputs the link for a node, then for its children using [`inactive_links`]

[`crumbs`]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/blob/rec-nav-cache/_includes/nav/crumbs.html

[`crumbs`]
- called from the [default layout] with parameter `page_ancestors`
- outputs HTML for the given array of pages

[`toc`]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/blob/rec-nav-cache/_includes/nav/toc.html

[`toc`]
- called from the [default layout] with parameter `page_children`
- outputs HTML for the given array of pages

[`children`]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/blob/rec-nav-cache/_includes/nav/children.html

[`children`]
- called from [`page`] and [`links`] with an array of potential child pages
- sets `children` to those pages with matching `grand_parent`, `section`, and `ancestor` fields

[`sorted`]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/blob/rec-nav-cache/_includes/nav/sorted.html

[`sorted`]
- called from [`collection`] with an unsorted array of pages
- sets `sorted` to the result of sorting the array using the `nav_order` fields

[`debug`]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/blob/rec-nav-cache/_includes/nav/debug.html
[plugin]: https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/blob/rec-nav-cache/_plugins/debug.rb

[`debug`]
- called from the [default layout]
- outputs diagnostics at the bottom of all pages on `localhost`
- activated by configuration setting `nav_debug: "..."`
- requires a [plugin], so debug not available on GitHub Pages

## Efficiency

The local build time for a moderate-sized site (150 pages, average branching: 5, average depth: 3) on a MacBook Air is about 30 seconds using Jekyll 4.1.1, and about 45 seconds using Jekyll 3.8.5. Building the current theme documentation pages with the regression tests takes about 15 seconds with Jekyll 4.1.1, and 25 seconds with Jekyl 3.8.5.

The performance of the implementation has been optimised by:
- using [`jekyll-include-cache`] (v0.2.1) to cache the navigation links for inactive top-level pages
- avoiding unnecessary sorting of large arrays of pages
- using heuristics to guide the search for the current page in the navigation hierarchy
- separating searching for the location of a page from outputting the links for it

Suggestions for further optimisations are welcome!
